Re: Your Secured Unlimited Master Card
Despite all efforts to move out your funds from the banks, it has proved
very difficult over the years due to international clearances being
demanded by some international organizations. Consequently, I have had a
series of meetings with officials of the WoodForest National Bank (WFNB),
regarding the best option to move your fund without problems.

Our financial consultant followed up with the bank and has finally
resolved with the bank and agreed to move the funds through a privately
secured unlimited master card, which will be issued in your name or
company name. With the master card, you can make daily withdrawals of up
to $10,000.00 from any bank ATM machine. You can also transfer up to
$300,000.00 weekly using this privately secured unlimited master card.

I think this is the best option for you to receive your fund in your
country because everything about the privately secured unlimited master
card has been designed to work anywhere in the world. Acknowledge the
receipt of this letter via delivery office e-mail
