automatic separation of scam emails


The program differs between scam and ham emails, as well as has the possiblity to categorize the scam emails into business and charity frauds (here its correctness is not yet perfect).

Please download the repository and start the program 'scamlab4_hopp.py'. It will analyze the emails as .eml files in the directory 'hamorscam' and uses the .txt files in the directory 'categories' for the decision process.
