automatic separation of scam emails


The program differs between scam and ham emails, as well as categorizes the scam emails into business, romantic and charity frauds. 

Please download the repository and start the program. It will analyze the emails as .eml files in the directory 'Hamorscam' and uses the .txt files in the directory 'categorizers' for the decision process.
